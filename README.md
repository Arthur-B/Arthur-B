## Intro

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am @Arthur-B, a PhD student in Material Science applying Machine Learning to develop nanomaterials with on demand properties.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, and generative processes.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently on a PyTorch deep dive, to apply some skills I learned during my PhD to new interesting problems. I am also learning Django to build some web app
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-baucour/)

## Recent projects

I have been working on a PyTorch implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). 
There are some nifty tricks to run the life simulation in parallel with minimal code thanks to convolutions and a simple neural network with fixed weights to perform logic operations.

Check out the repository: [`game-of-life`](https://github.com/Arthur-B/game-of-life)
