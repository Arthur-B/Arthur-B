## Intro

- 👋 Hi, I am @Arthur-B, a PhD student in Material Science applying Machine Learning to develop nanomaterials with on demand properties.
- 👀 I am interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, and generative processes.
- 🌱 I am currently on a PyTorch deep dive, to apply some skills I learned during my PhD to new interesting problems. I am also learning Django to build some web app.
- 📫 You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-baucour/)

### 🌱 Game of Life 🌱

I have been working on a PyTorch implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
There are some nifty tricks to run the life simulation in parallel with minimal code thanks to convolutions and a simple neural network with fixed weights to perform logic operations.

Check out the repository: [`game-of-life`](https://github.com/Arthur-B/game-of-life)

### 🐍 Reinforcement learning snake 🐍

Trying to teach my little computer how to play snake.
I developed a game environment tailored for reinforcement learning and implemented DQN algorithm in PyTorch.
Look at him go!
